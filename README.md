# Thesis_PCB_Design

This repository contains the KiCad files used to make the PCBs for the pressure sensor array.

## How to get started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open one of the KiCad project files (.kicad_pro).

Each PCB is tied to one KiCad project. So there are three KiCad projects in total. The mainboard is located in /BMP581_PCB/MainBoard/. The sensor strips connected to the top half of the wing are located in BMP581_PCB/SensorStrip_Top/, and finally the sensor strip connected to the bottom half of the wing are located in /BMP581_PCB/SensorStrip_Bottom/.
